# Aegis ID – Your Secure Digital Campus Pass

Aegis ID is a **mobile-first digital identity and access management system** designed to replace traditional college ID cards and manual entry processes. It offers a secure, fast, and modern way for students, wardens, and campus security to interact within the campus ecosystem.

---

## 🚀 What Our App Does

### **1. Digital Campus ID (Dynamic Passkey System)**
Aegis ID generates a **daily encrypted passkey** (QR/NFC) for students.

- Automatically refreshes
- Bound to the student's device
- Screenshot-protected (non-shareable)
- Can be scanned at gates for access validation

This eliminates the need for physical ID cards and reduces misuse or proxy entries.

---

## 🎒 Outpass Management

The app fully digitizes the outpass system:

- Students submit outpass requests  
- Wardens approve or reject with a single tap  
- Students receive instant notifications  
- All actions are logged for transparency  

No more queues, registers, or manual paperwork.

---

## 🚨 Emergency Support

Aegis ID includes a **one-tap emergency alert system**:

- Instantly call security or ambulance  
- App auto-shares GPS location  
- Emergency logged and tracked by campus authorities  

Ensures quick response during critical situations.

---

## 🔒 Secure Authentication & User Management

The system is built with strong security practices:

- JWT-based authentication  
- Bcrypt password hashing  
- SHA-256 encrypted passkeys  
- Role-based access: Student / Warden / Security / Admin  

Admins can manage users, logs, and system policies efficiently.

---

## 📱 Modern Mobile-First UI

Built using **React Native**, the app provides:

- Dashboard (Passkey | Outpass | Scan | Emergency)
- Profile management
- Outpass creation & tracking
- QR scanning interface
- Emergency alert screen

Clean UI, smooth navigation, and fast response time.

---

## ⚙️ Gate Access (QR / NFC)

Security guards can validate entries through:

- Scanning student's QR code  
- Reading NFC tags (supported devices)

Backend verifies:

- Token validity  
- Device ID match  
- Expiry time  
- Student role/status  

Result: Instant **Access Granted / Access Denied** response.
